 dev note: if you're wondering wtf this file is, it's simple, basically, I got obsessed with statistical methods for a couple days and now feels like a waste to delete this work so I'm keeping this antiquated shit around cuz i feel like it... exists solely for some obscure(but radical) feature for approximating a reasonable mean from some data manipulation performed on data parsed from user interactions(don't even bother wasting your time thinking about this for more time than you already have, unless your way smarter than me(hardly unlikely), in that case carry on and pardon my procrastination rant

 * ComputeReasonableAverage
 *
 * Computes a reasonable average of two values.
 * Given two values `max` and `min`, this function first determines the individual orders
 * of magnitude of the values, as well as their magnitude difference. It then uses this
 * information to compute a reasonable average, taking into consideration scenarios where
 * one value is vastly smaller or larger than the other.
 *
 * If the smaller value is as small (in magnitude) as the larger value is large (for example:
 * 10*e-11 and 10*e11), the function returns an average which is the value without the
 * orders of magnitude.
 *
 *
 * @param max The larger of the two numbers.
 * @param min The smaller of the two numbers.
 * @return The computed average.

/**
 * ComputeReasonableMean
 *
 * Reasonable Mean Computation.
 * This function combines several statistical methods to compute a mean value
 * that considers both the magnitude difference between two numbers and their
 * individual entropy. The method uses Huber's M-estimator for robustness against
 * outliers and skewed distributions, entropy for adaptive weighting, and Bayesian updating to
 * derive a posterior estimate.
 *
 *
 *
 ----- Bayesian Updating -----
 * In Bayesian statistics, the posterior distribution is proportional to the product of the likelihood and the prior.
 * Here, the likelihood represents our belief about the data given certain parameters, and the prior represents
 * our initial belief about those parameters before observing any data. After observing the data,
 * these two beliefs are combined to form a posterior belief about the parameters.
 *
 *
 *
 ----- Likelihood Formulations -----
 * Lp Norm Likelihood: The first likelihood is based on the Lp norm of the data, where the parameter 'p' is determined by the magnitude
 * difference between the min and max values. Assumed a Gaussian distribution centered at this mean, with a variance inversely
 * proportional to the entropy weight. The choice of Gaussian here can be interpreted as the "most uninformed" choice under maximum
 * entropy principles.
 *
 * Huber M-estimator Likelihood: The second likelihood is based on Huber's M-estimator, which provides a robust estimate of the mean.
 * Again, assumed a Gaussian distribution but with a variance controlled by 'δ', the Huber parameter.
 *
 *
 *
 ----- Entropy Weighting -----
 * Entropy is used as an uncertainty measure. In this context, it helps adjust the variance of the likelihood based on the Lp norm mean.
 * A lower entropy would indicate higher certainty and therefore lower variance, and vice versa.
 *
 *
 *
 ----- Posterior Computation -----
 * Use the product of Gaussians formula to combine these different sources of evidence. This formula is an analytical
 * solution for the posterior when all the involved distributions are Gaussian. The posterior mean is a weighted sum of all
 * the different 'mean' estimates, where the weights are determined by the variances of these estimates. Lower variance would imply
 * higher confidence and thus higher weight in this sum.
 *
 *
 * Step-by-step analysis of the ComputeReasonableMean function’s execution is provided in function implementation in 7 steps.
 *
 * @param min The minimum value.
 * @param max The maximum value.
 * @param delta Threshold for the Huber function, controlling the robustness.
 * @return The Bayesian "reasonable" mean.

 dev NOTE:
 The 'Vects' header and source files contain code that is not yet incorporated into the larger project and is still in experimental stages of development(probably no point in trying to learn how to make my own graphics thing using OpenGL when graphics won't really be a performance bottleneck for this simulation, that's just a bunch of dots, the real heavy lifting comes from the interactions between these dots and accurately approximating them to balance the insane computational complexity of direct simulations(O(N^2)) with reasonable accuracy, so these will probably find some use in some future thing, who knows, not me. So it almost definitely makes more sense to just use the existing stuff provided by OpenFrameworks.
